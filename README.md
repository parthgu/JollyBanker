## Overview
The Jolly Banker is a banking applicaition that processes transactions from an input .txt file. The program has all the functionality of a tradiontal bank.

A client account is represented by a first and last name (two strings) and a unique 4 digit identifier. A fifth digit can be added to the digit id to represent the individual fund within the account. The account transactions from the input file are placed into a que (first in first out) these accounts are then stored in a binary search tree for implementation in the correct order. Once all of the transactions in the que have been completed, all open accounts and balances will be printed.
